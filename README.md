# Aida

Aida is a block-processing testing infrastructure for EVM-compatible chains.

## Building the source

Building `aida` requires both a Go (version 1.19 or later), a C compiler, and bazel 5.2.3. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make
```
which builds all Aida tools. The aida tools can be found in ```build/...```.

## Testing 

For testing, a test database is required. You can obtain the test DB from here
```
TBD.
